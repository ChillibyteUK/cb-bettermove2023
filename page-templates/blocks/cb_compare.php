                            You enquire with several different Estate Agents and wait days or weeks for them to show.
                            The agent is more focused on winning your business from a competitor agent than what your
                            actual needs are.

                            Let's face it, nobody wants to sit around waiting for weeks for your property to be listed.
                            This does not need to be a slow, drawn out process.

                            Traditional Estate Agents may wait around for buyers to make contact or pop into the branch.
                            Your sale depends on any potential buyers getting in touch.

                            Generally speaking, reducing the asking price is the first thing you are told if the
                            property is not getting any interest. This is a lazy way of doing things, and is another way
                            of saying 'we were wrong about the value'.

                            strategy that meets those requirements. This is done immediately to allow us to get the

                            hasn't sold. We would rather be open and honest from the start and set a realistic price to
                            get your property sold without delay. That's why we are an awarding winning agency!
